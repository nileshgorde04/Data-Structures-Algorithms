Hint
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 

Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
 

Constraints:

0 <= x <= 231 - 1

//Solution

class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x < 2) return x;

        int low = 1, high = x / 2;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            long square = (long) mid * mid;

            if (square == x) {
                return mid;
            } else if (square < x) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return high;
    }
}
