Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.

if no such substring exists, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= 105

//Solution

class Solution {
    public int longestSubstring(String s, int k) {
        if (s.length() == 0) return 0;

        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (freq[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] < k) {
                int left = longestSubstring(s.substring(0, i), k);
                int right = longestSubstring(s.substring(i + 1), k);
                return Math.max(left, right);
            }
        }

        return s.length();
    }
}
