Hint
You are given an integer array nums of size n.

Consider a non-empty subarray from nums that has the maximum possible bitwise AND.

In other words, let k be the maximum value of the bitwise AND of any subarray of nums. Then, only subarrays with a bitwise AND equal to k should be considered.
Return the length of the longest such subarray.

The bitwise AND of an array is the bitwise AND of all the numbers in it.

A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise AND of a subarray is 3.
The longest subarray with that value is [3,3], so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise AND of a subarray is 4.
The longest subarray with that value is [4], so we return 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 106

//Solution

class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int max = Arrays.stream(nums).max().getAsInt(); 
        int count = 0;
        int maxCount = 0;

        for (int n : nums) {
            if (n == max) {
                count++;
                maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
            } else {
                count = 0;
            }
        }

        return maxCount;
    }
}
